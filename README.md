## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in training supervised machine models capable of predicting if a customer will purchase a car given their biodata as well as annual salary. 

## File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the questions posed above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 

## Results
The final model had an accuracy of 86%. A detailed description of the main findings of the code can be found at the post available <a href='https://medium.com/@davidalabintei97/do-you-want-to-create-a-supervised-ml-model-heres-how-ffb361ac398a'>here</a>.

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
Kaggle is due credit for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/cars-purchase-decision-dataset'>here</a>. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
